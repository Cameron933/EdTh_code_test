## 📝 Task Requirement

### Context

In a school, often teachers needs view and update student details.

### Requirements

Build a single-page list application in which a user should be able to:

- See a list of students in a table with just their full names and date of birth shown in localized format (ie: DD/MM/YYYY)
- When a student is selected from the table, a view of your choice (ie: a modal) will show the following details of the student
  - the student's profile image
  - First name
  - Last name
  - Date of birth
  - Address
    - Street line 1
    - Street line 2
    - Country
    - Postcode
- Only the first name and last names are editable. Other student details are **read only**.
- A teacher could update the first and last names of a student and **persist** it

You are provided with the following API endpoints:

```
GET http://localhost:5000/students
GET http://localhost:5000/students/:id
PATCH http://localhost:5000/students/:id
    Example: A request body of { date_of_birth: "foobar" } will update a students date of birth only. See db.json.
GET http://localhost:5000/profiles
GET http://localhost:5000/profiles/:id

```

- Occasionally the student and profile API endpoints may take a longer period of time to process a request, a sensible loading view/message should inform the user of this
- Occasionally the student and profiles API endpoints will be unresponsive and a sensible message should warn the user about their unavailability
- **Do not modify** `./server.js`
- You can use external libraries

### Starter app

You are provided with a starter app generated by [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).
However, feel free to use any frontend framework of your choice.

1. run `npm install`
2. run `npm run server:start` to access the aforementioned student & profile details
3. run `npm run start` to access starter app at localhost:3000

### Evaluation Criteria

This exercise is the opportunity to demonstrate your skills as a software engineer. So please build this application with techniques that you will apply as if this was a production ready app.

- Code quality
- Functionality
- Use of React/frontend engineering best practices
- Sensible technical decisions/assumptions if the requirements are open-ended
- Documentation

Note:

- CSS styling or a good looking application is not a core evaluation criteria. However feel free to make it look amazing.
- Feel free to use Typescript.
- We suggest you spend no more than 3 hours.

### Submission

Please **DO NOT** post your solution publicly.
